Abstract

   RFC 9728 defines OAuth 2.0 Protected Resource Metadata, enabling
   clients to dynamically discover the authorization requirements of
   protected resources.  Section 3.3 of RFC 9728 requires that when
   protected resource metadata is obtained via a WWW-Authenticate
   challenge, the resource value in the metadata MUST exactly match the
   URL the client used to access the protected resource, limiting the
   applicability of the specification.

   This document updates the resource validation rule in Section 3.3 of
   RFC 9728 to permit the resource value to be any URI that shares the
   same TLS origin (scheme, host, and port) as the requested URL and
   whose path is a prefix of the request URL path.  This enables a wider
   range of use cases for the WWW-Authenticate response.  All other
   aspects of RFC 9728 remain unchanged.

1.  Introduction

   This document updates one specific aspect of OAuth 2.0 Protected
   Resource Metadata [RFC9728]: the resource validation rule defined in
   Section 3.3.

   Section 3.3 of [RFC9728] requires that when a client retrieves
   protected resource metadata from a URL obtained via a WWW-
   Authenticate challenge, the resource value in the metadata response
   MUST be identical to the URL the client used to make the request that
   triggered the challenge.  This exact-match rule is intended to
   prevent a malicious resource from directing clients to metadata that
   impersonates a different resource.

   Consider a resource server at https://api.example.com that exposes
   the following protected resources:

   *  https://api.example.com/accounts

   *  https://api.example.com/transactions

   *  https://api.example.com/profile

   All three protected resources are served by the same authorization
   server (https://as.example.com) and accept tokens with the same
   audience (https://api.example.com).

   Under the current Section 3.3 rule in [RFC9728], when a client calls
   https://api.example.com/transactions without a token, the resource
   server responds:

HTTP/1.1 401 Unauthorized
WWW-Authenticate: Bearer resource_metadata="https://api.example.com/.well-known/oauth-protected-resource/transactions"

   The client retrieves the metadata, which per Section 3.3 of [RFC9728]
   MUST contain a resource value identical to the request URL:

   {
     "resource": "https://api.example.com/transactions",
     "authorization_servers": ["https://as.example.com"],
     ...
   }

   The client then requests a token using https://api.example.com/
   transactions as the resource parameter per [RFC8707].  The
   authorization server may issue a token whose audience is
   https://api.example.com (covering all protected resources on the
   server), but the client has no standardized way to know this.

   When the client subsequently needs to access https://api.example.com/
   accounts, it faces one of the following suboptimal outcomes:

   1.  It repeats the entire discovery and token-request flow for the
       new protected resource, wasting a round trip to the authorization
       server.

   2.  It speculatively reuses the existing token, which may work but is
       not grounded in any protocol signal from the resource server.

   3.  The authorization server must understand and enumerate every per-
       URL resource identifier that maps to a given audience, increasing
       configuration complexity.

   To avoid these outcomes, this document relaxes the exact-match
   requirement for resource values obtained via WWW-Authenticate
   discovery to a same-origin, path-prefix match.  See Section 4 for the
   normative specification.  Appendix A provides a non-normative example
   illustrating how the updated rule applies to APIs with fine-grained
   resource URLs.

2.  Conventions and Definitions

   The key words "MUST", "MUST NOT", "REQUIRED", "SHALL", "SHALL NOT",
   "SHOULD", "SHOULD NOT", "RECOMMENDED", "NOT RECOMMENDED", "MAY", and
   "OPTIONAL" in this document are to be interpreted as described in
   BCP 14 [RFC2119] [RFC8174] when, and only when, they appear in all
   capitals, as shown here.

3.  Terminology

   This document uses the following terms as defined in the referenced
   specifications:

   resource identifier:  An HTTPS URI that identifies a protected
      resource or set of protected resources, as defined in Section 1.2
      of [RFC9728] and [RFC8707].

   TLS origin:  The combination of scheme, host, and port derived from a
      URI, as defined in Section 4.3.2 of [RFC9110] for the https
      scheme.  Two URIs share the same TLS origin if and only if their
      scheme, host, and port (after applying default port rules) are
      identical.

   path prefix:  A path that matches the beginning of another path on a
      segment boundary.  See Section 4.3 for the precise definition.

   request URL:  The URL the client used to make the request that
      triggered the WWW-Authenticate challenge.

4.  Update to RFC 9728 Section 3.3

   This section contains the normative change to [RFC9728].  It updates
   only the resource validation rule in Section 3.3 of [RFC9728] that
   applies when metadata is retrieved via a WWW-Authenticate challenge.
   All other requirements in Section 3.3 and the rest of [RFC9728]
   remain in effect.

4.1.  Original Rule (Replaced)

   Section 3.3 of [RFC9728] states:

      If the protected resource metadata was retrieved from a URL
      returned by the protected resource via the WWW-Authenticate
      resource_metadata parameter, then the resource value returned MUST
      be identical to the URL that the client used to make the request
      to the resource server.  If these values are not identical, the
      data contained in the response MUST NOT be used.

   This document replaces the above requirement with the updated rule in
   Section 4.2.

4.2.  Updated Validation Rule

   When a client retrieves protected resource metadata from a URL
   obtained via the resource_metadata parameter in a WWW-Authenticate
   challenge (as defined in Section 5 of [RFC9728]), the client MUST
   verify ALL of the following conditions using the resource value from
   the metadata response and the URL the client used to make the request
   that triggered the challenge:

   1.  The scheme of the resource value MUST be https.

   2.  The host of the resource value MUST be identical (using case-
       insensitive comparison) to the host of the request URL.

   3.  The port of the resource value MUST be identical to the port of
       the request URL.  If either URL omits the port, the default port
       for the https scheme (443) MUST be used for comparison.

   4.  The path of the resource value MUST be a prefix of the path of
       the request URL, as defined in Section 4.3.

   If any of these conditions are not met, the client MUST NOT use the
   metadata, consistent with the security requirements of [RFC9728].

   Note that when the resource value is identical to the request URL,
   all four conditions are trivially satisfied.  This means the updated
   rule is fully backwards compatible with the original exact-match rule
   in [RFC9728]: any metadata that was valid under the original rule
   remains valid under this update.

   This update only applies to metadata retrieved via a WWW-Authenticate
   challenge.  The validation rule for metadata retrieved directly from
   a well-known URI is NOT changed by this document; the resource value
   MUST still be identical to the resource identifier from which the
   well-known URI was derived, as specified in Section 3.3 of [RFC9728].

4.3.  Path Prefix Matching

   This section defines the path prefix matching algorithm referenced by
   condition 4 of the updated validation rule in Section 4.2.

   The path of the resource value is a prefix of the path of the request
   URL if any of the following conditions hold:

   1.  The paths are identical (exact match).

   2.  The resource path ends with / and the request URL path starts
       with the resource path.  For example, a resource path of /api/v1/
       is a prefix of a request URL path of /api/v1/accounts.

   3.  The resource path does not end with /, and the request URL path
       is the resource path followed by / and optionally additional
       segments.  For example, a resource path of /api/v1 is a prefix of
       request URL paths /api/v1/ and /api/v1/accounts.

   Matching MUST occur on segment boundaries.  A resource path MUST NOT
   be treated as a prefix if the match would split a path segment.  For
   example, a resource path of /api/v1 MUST NOT match a request URL path
   of /api/v10 or /api/v1admin, because v10 and v1admin are distinct
   path segments from v1.

   Paths MUST be compared in their URI-normalized form per [RFC3986].
   Percent-encoded characters MUST be decoded before comparison.  An
   empty or absent path MUST be treated as / for comparison purposes.

   The following table illustrates the matching behavior:

               +===============+==================+========+
               | resource path | Request URL path | Match? |
               +===============+==================+========+
               | /             | /                | Yes    |

               | /             | /accounts        | Yes    |

               | /api/v1       | /api/v1/accounts | Yes    |
               +---------------+------------------+--------+
               | /api/v1       | /api/v1/         | Yes    |
               +---------------+------------------+--------+
               | /api/v1/      | /api/v1/accounts | Yes    |
               +---------------+------------------+--------+
               | /api/v1       | /api/v1          | Yes    |
               +---------------+------------------+--------+
               | /api/v1       | /api/v10         | *No*   |
               +---------------+------------------+--------+
               | /api/v1       | /api/v1admin     | *No*   |
               +---------------+------------------+--------+
               | /api/v1       | /api/v2/accounts | *No*   |

5.  Examples

   This section is non-normative.  It illustrates how the updated
   validation rule in Section 4 applies in practice.

5.1.  Host-Level Resource Identifier

   A resource server at https://api.example.com advertises a host-level
   resource identifier covering all of its protected resources.

   When a client requests https://api.example.com/transactions without a
   token:

HTTP/1.1 401 Unauthorized
WWW-Authenticate: Bearer resource_metadata="https://api.example.com/.well-known/oauth-protected-resource"

   The metadata response contains:

   {
     "resource": "https://api.example.com/",
     "authorization_servers": ["https://as.example.com"],
     "scopes_supported": ["accounts.read", "transactions.read",
       "profile.read"]
     ...
   }

   The client validates that https://api.example.com/ shares the same
   TLS origin as https://api.example.com/transactions and that the path
   / is a prefix of /transactions.

5.2.  Path-Level Resource Identifier

   A resource server at https://platform.example.com exposes two
   independent sets of protected resources under different path
   prefixes.

   When a client requests https://platform.example.com/api/v1/
   transactions without a token:

HTTP/1.1 401 Unauthorized
WWW-Authenticate: Bearer resource_metadata="https://platform.example.com/.well-known/oauth-protected-resource/api/v1"

   The metadata response contains:

   {
     "resource": "https://platform.example.com/api/v1",
     "authorization_servers": ["https://as.example.com"],
     "scopes_supported": ["transactions.read", "accounts.read"]
     ...
   }

   The client validates that https://platform.example.com/api/v1 shares
   the same TLS origin as https://platform.example.com/api/v1/
   transactions and that the path /api/v1 is a prefix of /api/v1/
   transactions on a segment boundary.

   A subsequent request to https://platform.example.com/api/v2/reports
   would NOT match the resource https://platform.example.com/api/v1
   because /api/v1 is not a prefix of /api/v2/reports.  The client would
   need to perform a separate discovery for the /api/v2 protected
   resources.

6.  Client Token Caching Guidance

   This section is non-normative.

   A client MAY maintain a token cache keyed by the tuple
   (authorization_server, resource), where authorization_server is the
   issuer identifier from which the token was obtained and resource is
   the resource value from the protected resource metadata.  A cached
   token MAY be reused for requests to any URL whose path falls under
   the same resource path prefix on the same TLS origin, provided the
   token was obtained from the same authorization server, has not
   expired, and carries sufficient scopes.

   A client MAY also optimistically reuse a cached token when accessing
   a URL under the same resource path prefix before performing metadata
   discovery for that URL.  If the resource server rejects the token
   (e.g., with a 401 response), the client falls back to the standard
   discovery flow.  The client should not assume that all protected
   resources under a given path prefix accept the same token.

7.  Security Considerations

   The security considerations of [RFC9728] (Section 7) continue to
   apply in full.  This section describes how the updated validation
   rule in Section 4 interacts with those considerations.

7.1.  Preservation of Origin Security Boundary

   Section 7.3 of [RFC9728] describes impersonation attacks where an
   adversary publishes metadata claiming to represent a legitimate
   resource.  The updated validation rule in Section 4.2 maintains the
   fundamental security property that prevents these attacks: the TLS
   origin check (conditions 1-3) ensures that the resource value is
   authoritative for the same server that issued the challenge.  An
   attacker who controls https://evil.example.com cannot cause a client
   to accept metadata with a resource value of https://api.example.com/,
   because the origins differ.

7.2.  Path-Level Isolation

   Some deployments host multiple independent services on the same
   origin, distinguished only by path (e.g., a shared hosting
   environment where https://shared.example.com/serviceA and
   https://shared.example.com/serviceB are operated by different
   tenants).  The path-prefix matching rule in this document supports
   these deployments: each service can advertise its own path-scoped
   resource identifier (e.g., https://shared.example.com/serviceA) that
   covers only protected resources under that path prefix.

   Resource servers in multi-tenant environments SHOULD use path-
   specific resource identifiers that maintain the necessary isolation
   between tenants.  A resource identifier of
   https://shared.example.com/serviceA will not match requests to
   https://shared.example.com/serviceB/resource because /serviceA is not
   a path prefix of /serviceB/resource.  This ensures that tokens
   obtained for one service cannot be inadvertently reused for another
   service on the same origin.

7.3.  Token Scope and Audience

   Relaxing the resource matching rule does not change the authorization
   server's responsibility to enforce audience restrictions on issued
   tokens.  The authorization server remains the authority on what
   resource(s) a token is valid for.  A client's use of a resource
   identifier (whether host-level or path-scoped) as the resource
   parameter in a token request is a signal to the authorization server,
   which MAY issue a token with a narrower or broader audience at its
   discretion.

7.4.  Sender-Constrained Tokens

   Deployments using sender-constrained tokens (e.g., DPoP [RFC9449])
   are compatible with the relaxed matching rule defined in this
   document.  The sender constraint binds the token to the client, not
   to a specific protected resource, so token reuse across protected
   resources on the same origin does not weaken the sender-constraint
   security property.

7.5.  Metadata Substitution Within an Origin

   The updated validation rule in Section 4.2 permits a protected
   resource to direct clients to metadata with a resource value that
   differs from the URL of the protected resource (but shares the same
   origin and satisfies the path-prefix condition).  This means that a
   compromised protected resource on an origin could direct clients to
   metadata controlled by another protected resource on the same origin.
   This risk is inherent to same-origin trust and is no different from
   the existing web security model, where all content on the same origin
   shares a trust boundary.  This risk also exists under the original
   [RFC9728] rule, since a compromised protected resource can already
   return arbitrary WWW-Authenticate challenges.

8.  IANA Considerations

   This document has no IANA actions.

Appendix A.  Resource Discovery for Fine-Grained APIs

   This non-normative example illustrates a common deployment pattern
   where the original exact-match validation rule in Section 3.3 of
   [RFC9728] creates a barrier to adoption, and shows how the updated
   rule in Section 4 resolves it.

A.1.  Exact-Match Constraint

   Consider a resource server that exposes individual user resources at
   unique URLs of the form https://example.com/users/{id}.

   A client that does not yet hold an access token makes a GET request
   to the resource.  The resource server responds with 401 Unauthorized
   and a WWW-Authenticate challenge identifying the Protected Resource
   Metadata document:

   GET /users/100 HTTP/1.1
   Host: example.com

   HTTP/1.1 401 Unauthorized
   WWW-Authenticate: Bearer resource_metadata=
     "https://example.com/.well-known/oauth-protected-resource"

   Following the discovery procedure in Section 3 of [RFC9728], the
   client retrieves the metadata document:

   GET /.well-known/oauth-protected-resource HTTP/1.1
   Host: example.com

   HTTP/1.1 200 OK
   Content-Type: application/json

   {
     "resource": "https://example.com/users/",
     "authorization_servers": ["https://as.example.com"],
     ...
   }

   Under the original Section 3.3 rule of [RFC9728], the resource value
   MUST be identical to the request URL https://example.com/users/100.
   Because the metadata instaed contains an invalid value of
   https://example.com/users/, the client MUST NOT use the metadata.

   To satisfy the original exact-match requirement, a resource server
   has two options.

   *Option 1: A distinct metadata document per resource URL.*

   Each resource URL requires its own Protected Resource Metadata
   document, for example:

   https://example.com/users/100/.well-known/...
   https://example.com/users/101/.well-known/...
   https://example.com/users/102/.well-known/...
   ...

   For APIs where the set of resource URLs is not fixed in advance, this
   creates an unbounded number of metadata documents to provision,
   serve, and keep consistent.  In practice this results in increased
   storage overhead, cache fragmentation, and operational complexity
   that scales linearly with the number of resources.

   *Option 2: Out-of-band knowledge of a representative resource URL.*

   To work around the exact-match constraint, a client could first make
   a GET request to a "parent" resource (e.g., https://example.com/
   users) in order to trigger a 401 Unauthorized response whose
   associated metadata contains a resource value of https://example.com/
   users.  The client would perform discovery against that URL, obtain
   an access token, and then use the access token to access
   https://example.com/users/100.

   GET /users HTTP/1.1
   Host: example.com

   HTTP/1.1 401 Unauthorized
   WWW-Authenticate: Bearer resource_metadata=
     "https://example.com/.well-known/oauth-protected-resource"

   This approach requires out-of-band knowledge of which URL to request
   first, which is not conveyed by the protocol.  It also introduces an
   additional round trip before the client can access the originally
   desired resource, increasing latency and complexity for every new
   client interaction.

A.2.  Resolution with the Updated Rule

   The updated validation rule in Section 4.2 permits the resource value
   to be any URI that shares the same TLS origin as the request URL and
   whose path is a prefix of the request URL path.  This allows a single
   metadata document to cover a collection of related resources,
   enabling straightforward discovery with no additional round trips or
   out-of-band coordination.

   A client that does not yet hold an access token makes a GET request
   to the resource.  The resource server responds with 401 Unauthorized
   and a WWW-Authenticate challenge:

   GET /users/100 HTTP/1.1
   Host: example.com

   HTTP/1.1 401 Unauthorized
   WWW-Authenticate: Bearer resource_metadata=
     "https://example.com/.well-known/oauth-protected-resource"

   The client retrieves the metadata document:

   GET /.well-known/oauth-protected-resource HTTP/1.1
   Host: example.com

   HTTP/1.1 200 OK
   Content-Type: application/json

   {
     "resource": "https://example.com/users/",
     "authorization_servers": ["https://as.example.com"],
     ...
   }

   The client validates that https://example.com/users/ shares the same
   TLS origin as https://example.com/users/100 and that the path /users/
   is a prefix of /users/100 on a segment boundary.  Both conditions are
   satisfied, so the client accepts the metadata.

   The client uses https://example.com/users/ as the resource indicator
   (per [RFC8707]) when requesting an access token from the
   authorization server.  The resulting access token can be reused for
   subsequent requests to https://example.com/users/101,
   https://example.com/users/102, and so on without repeating the
   discovery or token-request flow.
