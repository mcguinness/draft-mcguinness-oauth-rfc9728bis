Abstract

   RFC 9728 defines OAuth 2.0 Protected Resource Metadata, enabling
   clients to dynamically discover the authorization requirements of
   protected resources.  Section 3.3 of RFC 9728 requires that when
   protected resource metadata is obtained via a WWW-Authenticate
   challenge, the resource value in the metadata MUST exactly match the
   URL the client used to access the protected resource.

   This document updates the resource validation rule in Section 3.3 of
   RFC 9728 to permit the resource value to be any URI that shares the
   same TLS origin (scheme, host, and port) as the requested URL and
   whose path is a prefix of the request URL path.  All other aspects of
   RFC 9728 remain unchanged.

1.  Introduction

   This document updates one specific aspect of OAuth 2.0 Protected
   Resource Metadata [RFC9728]: the resource validation rule defined in
   Section 3.3.

   Section 3.3 of [RFC9728] requires that when a client retrieves
   protected resource metadata from a URL obtained via a WWW-
   Authenticate challenge, the resource value in the metadata response
   MUST be identical to the URL the client used to make the request that
   triggered the challenge.  This exact-match rule prevents a malicious
   resource from directing clients to metadata that impersonates a
   different resource.

   However, this rule creates a practical limitation when a resource
   server exposes multiple protected resources (e.g.,
   https://api.example.com/accounts, https://api.example.com/
   transactions, https://api.example.com/profile) that share the same
   authorization server and token audience.  Under the current rule, a
   client that discovers metadata for one protected resource cannot
   determine whether a token obtained for that resource will be accepted
   at other protected resources on the same server.  The client must
   either request a new token for each distinct protected resource or
   rely on out-of-band knowledge.  Related discussion of this problem
   can be found in [I-D.mcguinness-oauth-resource-token-resp].

   This document makes the following change to [RFC9728]:

   *  *Section 3.3 (Resource Validation)*: The exact-match requirement
      for resource values obtained via WWW-Authenticate discovery is
      relaxed to a same-origin, path-prefix match.  The resource value
      MUST share the same TLS origin (scheme, host, and port) as the
      request URL, and its path MUST be a prefix of the request URL path
      on a segment boundary.  This allows a resource server to advertise
      a resource identifier such as https://api.example.com/ or
      https://api.example.com/api/v1 that covers multiple protected
      resources under that path.

   All other aspects of [RFC9728] remain unchanged, including:

   *  The well-known URI construction rules (Section 3.1)

   *  The metadata response format (Section 3.2)

   *  The exact-match validation for direct well-known URI discovery
      (Section 3.3, first paragraph)

   *  The metadata content requirements (Section 4)

   *  The resource_metadata WWW-Authenticate parameter (Section 5)

2.  Conventions and Definitions

   The key words "MUST", "MUST NOT", "REQUIRED", "SHALL", "SHALL NOT",
   "SHOULD", "SHOULD NOT", "RECOMMENDED", "NOT RECOMMENDED", "MAY", and
   "OPTIONAL" in this document are to be interpreted as described in
   BCP 14 [RFC2119] [RFC8174] when, and only when, they appear in all
   capitals, as shown here.

3.  Terminology

   This document uses the following terms as defined in the referenced
   specifications:

   resource identifier:  An HTTPS URI that identifies a protected
      resource or set of protected resources, as defined in Section 1.2
      of [RFC9728] and [RFC8707].

   TLS origin:  The combination of scheme, host, and port derived from a
      URI, as defined in Section 4.3.2 of [RFC9110] for the https
      scheme.  Two URIs share the same TLS origin if and only if their
      scheme, host, and port (after applying default port rules) are
      identical.

   path prefix:  A path that matches the beginning of another path on a
      segment boundary.  One path is a prefix of another if the two are
      identical, if the first path ends with / and the second starts
      with it, or if the second path starts with the first followed by
      /.  For example, /api/v1 is a path prefix of /api/v1/accounts and
      /api/v1/, but is NOT a path prefix of /api/v10 or /api/v1admin.
      The root path / is a path prefix of all paths.

4.  Motivation

   This section is non-normative.  It describes the problem that
   motivates the change to [RFC9728].

   Consider a resource server at https://api.example.com that exposes
   the following protected resources:

   *  https://api.example.com/accounts

   *  https://api.example.com/transactions

   *  https://api.example.com/profile

   All three protected resources are served by the same authorization
   server (https://as.example.com) and accept tokens with the same
   audience (https://api.example.com).

   Under the current Section 3.3 rule in [RFC9728], when a client calls
   https://api.example.com/transactions without a token, the resource
   server responds:

   HTTP/1.1 401 Unauthorized
   WWW-Authenticate: Bearer resource_metadata="https://api.example.com/
     .well-known/oauth-protected-resource/transactions"

   The client retrieves the metadata, which per Section 3.3 of [RFC9728]
   MUST contain a resource value identical to the request URL:

   {
     "resource": "https://api.example.com/transactions",
     "authorization_servers": ["https://as.example.com"],
     ...
   }

   The client then requests a token using https://api.example.com/
   transactions as the resource parameter per [RFC8707].  The
   authorization server may issue a token whose audience is
   https://api.example.com (covering all protected resources on the
   server), but the client has no standardized way to know this.

   When the client subsequently needs to access https://api.example.com/
   accounts, it faces one of the following suboptimal outcomes:

   1.  It repeats the entire discovery and token-request flow for the
       new protected resource, wasting a round trip to the authorization
       server.

   2.  It speculatively reuses the existing token, which may work but is
       not grounded in any protocol signal from the resource server.

   3.  The authorization server must understand and enumerate every per-
       URL resource identifier that maps to a given audience, increasing
       configuration complexity.

5.  Update to RFC 9728 Section 3.3

   This section contains the normative change to [RFC9728].  It updates
   only the resource validation rule in Section 3.3 of [RFC9728] that
   applies when metadata is retrieved via a WWW-Authenticate challenge.
   All other requirements in Section 3.3 and the rest of [RFC9728]
   remain in effect.

5.1.  Original Rule (Replaced)

   Section 3.3 of [RFC9728] states:

      If the protected resource metadata was retrieved from a URL
      returned by the protected resource via the WWW-Authenticate
      resource_metadata parameter, then the resource value returned MUST
      be identical to the URL that the client used to make the request.
      [...] If these values are not identical, the data contained in the
      response MUST NOT be used.

   This document replaces the above requirement with the updated rule in
   Section 5.2.

5.2.  Updated Validation Rule

   When a client retrieves protected resource metadata from a URL
   obtained via the resource_metadata parameter in a WWW-Authenticate
   challenge (as defined in Section 5 of [RFC9728]), the client MUST
   verify ALL of the following conditions using the resource value from
   the metadata response and the URL the client used to make the request
   that triggered the challenge:

   1.  The scheme of the resource value MUST be https.

   2.  The host of the resource value MUST be identical (using case-
       insensitive comparison) to the host of the request URL.

   3.  The port of the resource value MUST be identical to the port of
       the request URL.  If either URL omits the port, the default port
       for the https scheme (443) MUST be used for comparison.

   4.  The path of the resource value MUST be a prefix of the path of
       the request URL, as defined in Section 5.4.

   If any of these conditions are not met, the client MUST NOT use the
   metadata, consistent with the security requirements of [RFC9728].

   Note that when the resource value is identical to the request URL,
   all four conditions are trivially satisfied.  This means the updated
   rule is fully backwards compatible with the original exact-match rule
   in [RFC9728]: any metadata that was valid under the original rule
   remains valid under this update.

5.3.  Unchanged: Validation for Well-Known URI Discovery

   The validation rule in Section 3.3 of [RFC9728] for metadata
   retrieved directly from a well-known URI (i.e., not via a WWW-
   Authenticate challenge) is NOT changed by this document.  The
   resource value MUST still be identical to the protected resource's
   resource identifier value from which the well-known URI was derived,
   as specified in Section 3.3 of [RFC9728].

5.4.  Path Prefix Matching

   This section defines the path prefix matching algorithm referenced by
   condition 4 of the updated validation rule in Section 5.2.

   The path of the resource value is a prefix of the path of the request
   URL if any of the following conditions hold:

   1.  The paths are identical (exact match).

   2.  The resource path ends with / and the request URL path starts
       with the resource path.  For example, a resource path of /api/v1/
       is a prefix of a request URL path of /api/v1/accounts.

   3.  The resource path does not end with /, and the request URL path
       is the resource path followed by / and optionally additional
       segments.  For example, a resource path of /api/v1 is a prefix of
       request URL paths /api/v1/ and /api/v1/accounts.

   Matching MUST occur on segment boundaries.  A resource path MUST NOT
   be treated as a prefix if the match would split a path segment.  For
   example, a resource path of /api/v1 MUST NOT match a request URL path
   of /api/v10 or /api/v1admin, because v10 and v1admin are distinct
   path segments from v1.

   Paths MUST be compared in their URI-normalized form per [RFC3986].
   Percent-encoded characters MUST be decoded before comparison.  An
   empty or absent path MUST be treated as / for comparison purposes.

   The following table illustrates the matching behavior:

               +===============+==================+========+
               | resource path | Request URL path | Match? |
               +===============+==================+========+
               | /             | /accounts        | Yes    |
               +---------------+------------------+--------+
               | /             | /api/v1/accounts | Yes    |
               +---------------+------------------+--------+
               | /api          | /api/v1/accounts | Yes    |
               +---------------+------------------+--------+
               | /api/         | /api/v1/accounts | Yes    |
               +---------------+------------------+--------+
               | /api/v1       | /api/v1/accounts | Yes    |
               +---------------+------------------+--------+
               | /api/v1       | /api/v1/         | Yes    |
               +---------------+------------------+--------+
               | /api/v1/      | /api/v1/accounts | Yes    |
               +---------------+------------------+--------+
               | /api/v1       | /api/v1          | Yes    |
               +---------------+------------------+--------+
               | /api/v1       | /api/v10         | *No*   |
               +---------------+------------------+--------+
               | /api/v1       | /api/v1admin     | *No*   |
               +---------------+------------------+--------+
               | /api/v1       | /api/v2/accounts | *No*   |
               +---------------+------------------+--------+
               | /api/v1       | /other           | *No*   |

               | /accounts     | /transactions    | *No*   |
               +---------------+------------------+--------+

                                  Table 1

6.  Examples

   This section is non-normative.  It illustrates how the updated
   validation rule in Section 5 applies in practice.

6.1.  Host-Level Resource Identifier

   A resource server at https://api.example.com advertises a host-level
   resource identifier covering all its protected resources.  When a
   client requests https://api.example.com/transactions without a token:

   HTTP/1.1 401 Unauthorized
   WWW-Authenticate: Bearer resource_metadata="https://api.example.com/
     .well-known/oauth-protected-resource"

   The metadata response contains:

   {
     "resource": "https://api.example.com/",
     "authorization_servers": ["https://as.example.com"],
     "scopes_supported": ["accounts.read", "transactions.read",
       "profile.read"],
     "bearer_methods_supported": ["header"],
     "resource_signing_alg_values_supported": ["RS256"]
   }

   Under the original Section 3.3 rule in [RFC9728], this metadata would
   be rejected because https://api.example.com/ is not identical to
   https://api.example.com/transactions.

   Under the updated rule in Section 5.2, the client validates that
   https://api.example.com/ shares the same TLS origin as
   https://api.example.com/transactions (conditions 1-3) and that the
   path / is a prefix of /transactions (condition 4).  All checks
   succeed, so the client uses https://api.example.com/ as the resource
   parameter in its token request.

6.2.  Path-Level Resource Identifier

   A resource server at https://platform.example.com exposes two
   independent sets of protected resources under different path
   prefixes.  When a client requests
   https://platform.example.com/api/v1/transactions without a token:

   HTTP/1.1 401 Unauthorized
   WWW-Authenticate: Bearer resource_metadata=
     "https://platform.example.com/.well-known/
     oauth-protected-resource/api/v1"

   The metadata response contains:

   {
     "resource": "https://platform.example.com/api/v1",
     "authorization_servers": ["https://as.example.com"],
     "scopes_supported": ["transactions.read", "accounts.read"],
     "bearer_methods_supported": ["header"]
   }

   The client validates that https://platform.example.com/api/v1 shares
   the same TLS origin as https://platform.example.com/api/v1/
   transactions (conditions 1-3) and that the path /api/v1 is a prefix
   of /api/v1/transactions on a segment boundary (condition 4).  All
   checks succeed.

   A subsequent request to https://platform.example.com/api/v2/reports
   would NOT match the resource https://platform.example.com/api/v1
   because /api/v1 is not a prefix of /api/v2/reports (condition 4
   fails).  The client would need to perform a separate discovery for
   the /api/v2 protected resources.

7.  Client Token Caching Guidance

   This section is non-normative.  It describes one approach clients MAY
   use to take advantage of the relaxed resource matching rule.  Clients
   are not required to implement token caching; a client that requests a
   fresh token for every protected resource access remains fully
   compliant.

7.1.  Token Cache Key

   A client that chooses to cache tokens MAY maintain a token cache
   (informally, a "token jar") keyed by the tuple:

   (authorization_server, resource)

   where:

   *  authorization_server is the issuer identifier of the authorization
      server from which the token was obtained.

   *  resource is the resource value from the protected resource
      metadata.

7.2.  Token Reuse Across Protected Resources

   When a client needs to access a protected resource and already holds
   a non-expired token in its cache, it MAY reuse that token if all of
   the following conditions are met:

   1.  The client has previously retrieved protected resource metadata
       for the target protected resource (or another protected resource
       whose resource identifier's path is a prefix of the target URL's
       path on the same TLS origin) that contains the same resource
       value.

   2.  The cached token was obtained from the same authorization server
       identified in the metadata for the target protected resource.

   3.  The cached token has not expired and has not been revoked.

   4.  The scopes associated with the cached token are sufficient for
       the intended request, to the extent the client can determine
       this.

   If any condition is not met, the client would need to perform a new
   token request.

7.3.  Optimistic Token Reuse

   A client that has discovered a resource identifier for one protected
   resource MAY optimistically attempt to use a cached token when
   accessing another protected resource whose URL path starts with the
   resource path, even before performing metadata discovery for that
   protected resource.  If the resource server rejects the token (e.g.,
   with a 401 response), the client falls back to the standard discovery
   flow for the new protected resource.

   This optimistic reuse can reduce latency in common cases but does not
   relax any security requirements.  The client should be prepared for
   the token to be rejected and should not assume that all protected
   resources under a given resource path prefix accept the same token.

8.  Security Considerations

   The security considerations of [RFC9728] (Section 7) continue to
   apply in full.  This section describes how the updated validation
   rule in Section 5 interacts with those considerations.

8.1.  Preservation of Origin Security Boundary

   Section 7.3 of [RFC9728] describes impersonation attacks where an
   adversary publishes metadata claiming to represent a legitimate
   resource.  The updated validation rule in Section 5.2 maintains the
   fundamental security property that prevents these attacks: the TLS
   origin check (conditions 1-3) ensures that the resource value is
   authoritative for the same server that issued the challenge.  An
   attacker who controls https://evil.example.com cannot cause a client
   to accept metadata with a resource value of https://api.example.com/,
   because the origins differ.

8.2.  Path-Level Isolation

   Some deployments host multiple independent services on the same
   origin, distinguished only by path (e.g., a shared hosting
   environment where https://shared.example.com/serviceA and
   https://shared.example.com/serviceB are operated by different
   tenants).  The path-prefix matching rule in this document supports
   these deployments: each service can advertise its own path-scoped
   resource identifier (e.g., https://shared.example.com/serviceA) that
   covers only protected resources under that path prefix.

   Resource servers in multi-tenant environments SHOULD use path-
   specific resource identifiers that maintain the necessary isolation
   between tenants.  A resource identifier of
   https://shared.example.com/serviceA will not match requests to
   https://shared.example.com/serviceB/resource because /serviceA is not
   a path prefix of /serviceB/resource.  This ensures that tokens
   obtained for one service cannot be inadvertently reused for another
   service on the same origin.

8.3.  Token Scope and Audience

   Relaxing the resource matching rule does not change the authorization
   server's responsibility to enforce audience restrictions on issued
   tokens.  The authorization server remains the authority on what
   resource(s) a token is valid for.  A client's use of a resource
   identifier (whether host-level or path-scoped) as the resource
   parameter in a token request is a signal to the authorization server,
   which MAY issue a token with a narrower or broader audience at its
   discretion.

8.4.  Sender-Constrained Tokens

   Deployments using sender-constrained tokens (e.g., DPoP [RFC9449])
   are compatible with the relaxed matching rule defined in this
   document.  The sender constraint binds the token to the client, not
   to a specific protected resource, so token reuse across protected
   resources on the same origin does not weaken the sender-constraint
   security property.

8.5.  Metadata Substitution Within an Origin

   The updated validation rule in Section 5.2 permits a protected
   resource to direct clients to metadata with a resource value that
   differs from the URL of the protected resource (but shares the same
   origin and satisfies the path-prefix condition).  This means that a
   compromised protected resource on an origin could direct clients to
   metadata controlled by another protected resource on the same origin.
   This risk is inherent to same-origin trust and is no different from
   the existing web security model, where all content on the same origin
   shares a trust boundary.  This risk also exists under the original
   [RFC9728] rule, since a compromised protected resource can already
   return arbitrary WWW-Authenticate challenges.
